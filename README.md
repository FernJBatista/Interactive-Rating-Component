## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   JavaScript

### What I learned

I've been dwelling into JavaScript now, I still don't understand much of it and I rely on help a lot, but I'm trying to slowly make sense of it. I just don't know when to use what, but after I see how it's done I fel like I should've been able to get it before :c

### Useful resources

-   [Pamela Dayne - Just very simple radio buttons](https://codepen.io/pamdayne/pen/jqxYBx) - This helped me get a proper look for the radio buttons in my project. I wasn't sure about how to work on this sectio nat first, but thanks to this I was able to arrange most of it as I needed.
